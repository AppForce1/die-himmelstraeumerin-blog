# Hi! I'm Feli ðŸ‘‹

I'm iOS developer from Nuremberg, Germany.

My focus is building apps with **user experience and accessibility** in mind.

## What I work on in my free time

- I make sketchnotes and write blog posts
- I often improve something on my website, thereby I learn more about CSS & HTML and best practices in frontend development
- I like to play around with APIs or new iOS features, which I try out in [Cineaste App (iOS)][cineaste], if it makes sense for the app
- I'm glad I discovered [Critical Maps (iOS)][criticalmaps] where I can contribute to and help maintaining the project ðŸš²
