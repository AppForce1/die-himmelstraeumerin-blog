Can‚Äôt believe another year is over. I want it to be a tradition to reflect about the last year. I wrote down my thoughts about [2019](https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/thoughts-about-2019/) and [2020](https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/thoughts-about-2020/) and it helped me to remind me of my challenges, learnings and what I enjoyed the most.

2021 was definitely a year with lots of ups and downs for me!

<h2 id="quit-job">I quit my very first job and now... what?</h2>

The year definitely started with a low for me. I couldn‚Äôt focus and was restless, driveless and emotional very quickly. I‚Äôve quit my very first job with lots of emotions inside me. I‚Äôve read somewhere that you‚Äôre more attached to your first job than others. I can say it wasn‚Äôt an easy decision but I needed a change. So, without having an alternative in sight, I quit my job.

I needed time to get some distance and to be able to think clearly again. "What‚Äôs next?" was a question I was asking myself a lot. Should I continue developing iOS apps or try out something totally different? Maybe working as harvester? Selling ice cream? Doing some volunteer work? Helping others? **Working on something that really matters?** I tried to find something like that half-hearted, but nothing worked out. Perhaps because I didn‚Äôt really try hard enough.

But there was a way to combine my experience with something that really matters to me: **developing apps with accessibility in mind.** So at some point, I started to apply for iOS developer positions again.

Developing iOS apps is what I learned, what I‚Äôm experienced in and what brings me joy (normally) but I learned that **I need the focus on accessibility**. So I tested the accessibility on apps before I applied to the job. So many apps don‚Äôt even have basic accessibility support for Dynamic Type or Voice Over. You would get most of the features for free when you would use standard UI elements. But of course (üòí) that‚Äôs not what most companys do. They want their own UI elements... and forget implementing accessibility features on top of the elements. When I talked about that in some interviews, I heard a lot of excuses. But when I look back, I‚Äôm glad that it didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôm tired of trying to change peoples mindsets. If they don‚Äôt know about accessibility in 2021, they possibly just don‚Äôt want to know about it. It seems like they don‚Äôt care. So I don‚Äôt care about working for them. I know that now.

What surprised me is that most companies prioritize to find out **how you write code** over how much you know about things that would help actual users to use their app. The kind of questions they ask are mostly about design patterns and architecture, which is fine when you‚Äôre interviewing for a non junior position, but in most interviews I wasn‚Äôt asked **any questions** about how I would build accessible apps.

You get asked about a lot of different topics in interviews which you don‚Äôt have to explain every day, so I sat down and re-learned some iOS basics. I created a few "easy to look up" sketchnotes about possible iOS interview topics. See the [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1371471736382832641?s=20) or the [blog post with more details](https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/summaries-ios-interview-topics/) about it. For one of my interviews I also did refreshers on algorithms, data structures, system design and behavioral interviews, but they‚Äôre not on my website (yet). Would someone be interested in these?

At some point I was yolo enough to just send out applications even though I didn‚Äôt even think the company will ever reach out to me. But the opposite happened and I went through all interviews at Spotify successfully to my surprise. Well, kinda. But in the end, I got a job offer and finally accepted. ü•≥

My biggest reasons for joining Spotify were:

- I‚Äôm a big fan of the Spotify app and use it every day myself
- they cares deeply about topics like accessibility and inclusion
- the role is perfect for me: I‚Äôm working on the design system - very UI focused - to make it easy for others to build accessible UI components
- many intelligent and amazing people work there, so I can learn a lot from them

<h2 id="ios-chats">Participate in iOS Chats</h2>

I did my very first interview about how I started with iOS development and more! [Filip Nƒõmeƒçek](https://twitter.com/nemecek_f) interviewed me for **[iOS Chats](https://nemecek.be/chats/)** in March! It was super fun and you can read about it here:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@felibe444</a> about getting into <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOSDev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iOSDev</a>, working on open source projects, about her wonderful sketchnotes ‚úèÔ∏è and more <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOSChat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iOSChat</a> üí¨<a href="https://t.co/HClZ8IIA2Q">https://t.co/HClZ8IIA2Q</a></p>&mdash; Filip Nemecek (@nemecek_f) <a href="https://twitter.com/nemecek_f/status/1377312343479230466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2 id="cool-kids">How to be one of the cool kids</h2>

End of March, I got my first longboard and started to learn how to ride it. This is one of the things which looks super easy when you watch a pro, but you need to stand on a board once to understand that you need a lot of time, practice and passion to get so good that it looks easy. It‚Äôs even a bit scary in the beginning... but it‚Äôs also super fun! And after a short time you get to see and feel the progress.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happiness ‚òÄÔ∏èüå≥üõπ <a href="https://t.co/y5VDxDi7mH">pic.twitter.com/y5VDxDi7mH</a></p>&mdash; Feli #DieHimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1391406829075406853?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After a few weeks, I even started to learn some tricks and you need to be super brave to jump on or with the board! You have to outplay your mind and just do it, which sounds easy... but guess what... it‚Äôs not! I usually tried the tricks on grass first to build up some confidence (and trick my brain) before I tried them on the street. 

Looking forward to good weather to continue my journey on the board.

<h2 id="remote-conferences">More remote conferences</h2>

I enjoy being on conferences, even remote ones! When I saw the speaker line up, I immediately knew, that I don‚Äôt want to miss SwiftHeroes in April 2021.
If you‚Äôre interested in my sketchnotes of the talks I watched, you can find them in [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1382957511305744386?s=20) or [on my website](https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/swiftheroes21/). They had two tracks, so I had to decide which talk I want to see. You can watch [all the talks on their youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AiHp8OaTE0&list=PLfCiO1zYKkAQ8jelBHLYqNd98dWoB7850). 

This tweet made my day: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So these are my notes then üòÉ thanks for the wonderful sketchnotes! <a href="https://t.co/ySf65hERR2">pic.twitter.com/ySf65hERR2</a></p>&mdash; Filip Nemecek (@nemecek_f) <a href="https://twitter.com/nemecek_f/status/1383005144644792322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2 id="viral-tweet">First Viral Tweet???</h2>

In June, it was WWDC time! Aaaaand somehow my keynote sketchnote exploded on twitter üòÑ This was definitely **the tweet with the most interactions and impressions** on my feed, not only in 2021, but EVER. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">WWDC Keynote 2021 ü•≥ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC21?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWDC21</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sketchnote?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sketchnote</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sketchnoting?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sketchnoting</a> <a href="https://t.co/tnXC1GmGTF">pic.twitter.com/tnXC1GmGTF</a></p>&mdash; Feli #DieHimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1401975930822795268?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I‚Äôm really happy when people enjoy my sketchnotes and support me in what I‚Äôm doing. It makes all the effort of doing live sketchnotes on conferences or keynotes even more worth. **Thank you for your support** üôè

<h2 id="mental-health">Let‚Äôs talk about mental health</h2>

In August, I shared some of my routines which help me to take care of my mental health. Read [about my routines and about how it‚Äôs really going](https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/2021-08-22-well-being/).

For me the most important things are:

- Get enough sleep
- Set boundaries
- Move every day
- Meditate and be mindful

But, of course, only knowing about what helps your mental health isn‚Äôt enough, you also have to do these things. Obviously. That was my personal project the whole year (and it will also be in the future) and I‚Äôm improving a lot, but also get reminded quite quickly how important it is for me, if I let it slip for some days or even weeks.

I‚Äôm very glad that Spotify has a mental health initiative called [Heart & Soul](https://lifeatspotify.com/diversity-equity-impact/mental-health) to "raise awareness and remove stigma, provide proactive self-care and professional support, and normalize the conversation surrounding mental health". They provide a lot of materials to inform about the impact of mental health. All employees had a [Wellness week](https://hrblog.spotify.com/2021/11/01/spotify-wellness-week/) in November for exactly this reason and the [World Mental Health Day](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-10-07/spotify-encourages-everyone-to-take-a-beat-on-world-mental-health-day-and-everyday/) was celebrated internally with virtual talks, workshops, and panels related to mental well-being. All employees were encouraged to participate and not "work on their normal tasks" this day.

These initiatives help me to think about my mental health more often. It‚Äôs not a taboo topic, it‚Äôs present in our daily lives and that‚Äôs one thing I really love about Spotify.

**It‚Äôs okay to not be okay.**

<h2 id="sketchnotes">Gimme more sketchnotes</h2>

In November, I did my first sketchnoting workshop at Spotify in a smaller setting with my squad and our sister squad. It was the first workshop in 2021 and around one year after my workshop at NSSpain 2020! 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It‚Äôs <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sketchnoting?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sketchnoting</a> week for me and I already enjoy it so much! <br>ü•≥ Yesterday I gave a workshop for the first time in a year and it was awesome üòç<br>üç∑And the next two days I‚Äôm gonna watch some amazing talks at <a href="https://twitter.com/NSSpain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NSSpain</a> and (of course) post my sketchnotes here üòâ Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/isZlWUqleL">pic.twitter.com/isZlWUqleL</a></p>&mdash; Feli #DieHimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1461020594259038220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The workshop was of course remote for everyone and in English! **It was a huge success and it was so much fun!** The best thing after a workshop is to see people continue using their newly learned technique and even people who were really sceptical about this beforehand, changed their minds and were totally focussed in the workshop and loved it. ü•∞

In the same week, it was NSSpain 2021 as well! Yay! You can see my NSSpain sketchnotes [on twitter](https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1461271436425891842?s=20) or [on my website](https://fbernutz.github.io/tags/nsspain21/). This time I was a bit more confident than last year to talk to others in English, because it‚Äôs my new normal now at work. But it still costs me a great deal of effort to talk to others, so I‚Äôm super proud that I did it. I‚Äôm happy that I got to meet a lot of new people üëã

The most surprising thing happened after I joined a table to talk to others, I was asked if I was "the same Feli who creates the sketchnotes" and that they had only three tabs in their browser: one for the conference platform, one for the agenda and my Twitter thread with the sketchnotes üòÜ I never thought something like this would ever happen! But definitely the best feeling! Thank you for sharing that with me! It made my day and I still smile when I think about it.

<h2 id="working-from-home">Still working from home</h2>

Since the pandemic started in March 2020, I‚Äôm working from home. Since I started at Spotify, I‚Äôm even working from home officially. So even if there were offices in my area and they would open, I could stay at home. It changed from a situational and temporary setup to a long term setup.

After nearly two years now, I can definitely say, I don‚Äôt like the lonely lunch breaks. So, if it‚Äôs safe to do so, I really enjoy meeting friends during the lunch break! I‚Äôll definitely try to do that more often in 2022. If anyone wants to be my lunch buddy and is in my area, write me a message haha üòÜ

I‚Äôm also really looking forward to meet the folks from my new team in real person some day (maybe in 2022 ü§û). I have never met them in real life before!

In general, I still like working from home! Since it‚Äôs now long term setup, I made my **work station as ergonomic as possible**, so I got a height adjustable desk, a new chair, a pillow to put my feet on (it‚Äôs so comfy), a new ergonomic mouse and a 4K monitor. Yes, that‚Äôs a lot, but I can already feel how good it is for my back and also for how I feel when I work on my desk. I just love it there, so I‚Äôm having a lot of positive emotions when working, just because it‚Äôs comfy and highly adjustable. Can only recommend to invest in that.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">...and it&#39;s finally coming together quite nicely! Don&#39;t you think? <a href="https://t.co/xGvC7hvFbo">pic.twitter.com/xGvC7hvFbo</a></p>&mdash; Feli #DieHimmelstraeumerin (@felibe444) <a href="https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1460299090777059339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It‚Äôs the most exciting thing to **talk to others from different countries with just a button tap**. During my virtual Intro Days at Spotify, I talked to people from New Delhi, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Paris and Tokyo. This still blows my mind how easy it is and I love it! 

That **everything is now in English** was something I was a bit scared of in the beginning. I was constantly using a translator to double check if my messages were correct and I forgot the translation for a lot of words in live conversations. I was just not used to use my English skills. But this is now different after six months. Of course, practice is the key and I‚Äôm now more in the "I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs correct" mood because most of the people are non native speakers as well and they have the same issues sometimes. Usually you‚Äôll understand each other even if it‚Äôs not 100% gramatically correct. So, I feel more light-hearted about this topic now. It already happened a LOT of times that I think in English or I don‚Äôt remember the German word for something or I‚Äôm randomly asking others what this German word would be in English, because I was just thinking about it. üòÖ By the way, if you‚Äôre a non native speaker and have trouble in pair programming sessions to name signs like these `()[]{},.:*` correctly, here is a [service tweet](https://twitter.com/felibe444/status/1382611757462605824?s=20) for you. I constantly forget how you call these. But I guess in a year this won‚Äôt be an issues anymore, at all.

<h2 id="sport">I love sport</h2>

I started to go rock climbing in 2020 and I still enjoy it a lot. Being in the nature with my sister, her husband and other lovely people is the best thing I can imagine for a perfect weekend. 

**Rock climbing is not only about muscles and technique, but also about mental strength and trust in your abilities.** Most of the time I‚Äôm not very brave when I‚Äôm at a difficult part of the route and I fear to fall in the rope. I need others to cheer me on to at least try it, to actually try it. Sometimes this helps and I‚Äôm succeeding but sometimes I just give up without trying at all. It‚Äôs fine as well, because climbing for me is about having fun and I will definitely come back and try it again the next time. Overcoming my fears is something I will continue to work on in 2022, because fear shouldn‚Äôt stop me, that‚Äôs why I have the rope and someone I trust as my belayer.

I‚Äôm grateful to spend so much time with my sister doing something we both enjoy a lot. ‚ù§Ô∏è

In 2020, I started to **go swimming again and wanted to learn freestyle**. At that time I couldn‚Äôt even do two strokes before I started having panic attacks and needed a break to breathe. Read about [my swimming journey](https://fbernutz.github.io/posts/2021-09-25-one-year-swimming/) if you haven‚Äôt already. But now I can‚Äôt wait to go swimming again! The second half of 2021 was the time where I improved a lot! Since late November you need to get a negative rapid test at an official test center in order to enter the swimming pool, so I wasn‚Äôt swimming a lot anymore. It was too time consuming in my opinion. I also need 30 minutes to get to the swimming pool plus the time to ride to a test center, wait for your turn and for the result... But I will continue with swimming when it‚Äôs more safe and a bit less time consuming in 2022.

My record in 2021 was, that I suprisingly swam 2km in under 1 hour, most of it in freestyle. That‚Äôs a HUGE success for me and I couldn‚Äôt be more proud ü•≥

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally I had the time to swim more than half an hour and it was just awesome!

It‚Äôs a tradition to analyze my annual commit history at the end of December. The report is only from my personal work in 2021. Credits for the [script](https://gist.github.com/markusfisch/c43e32a50f833539ea0f7b8b6109320e) go to [@markusfisch](https://twitter.com/markusfisch).

I wasn‚Äôt very active in my side projects in 2021 compared to the year before. I love that "Sketchnote" is top 2 of my most used words in commit messages, because it means I‚Äôve uploaded a lot of new sketchnotes on my website! üôå

I‚Äôm always a bit scared of challenges and trying out new things... but all in all 2021 proves that I can do it anyway. I worked a lot on being more brave and going for the change and gladly it worked out for me. I‚Äôm super proud and grateful for that experiences and all the new people I met.

Stay safe everyone and a happy new year!
